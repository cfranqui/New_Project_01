                <p> <strong> Ridgewood</strong> is a neighborhood located in the New York City borough of Queens. A borough in lay mans terms is basically a collection of neighborhoods which when brought together form a larger neightborhood. If this doesn't make sense its fine, since we will talk about it later. The borough of Queens is in turn part of New York City. Ridgewood is straddled between the Queens-Brooklyn boundary.</p>
          
                    <p>Ridgewood was settled by the British in the 17th century as relatively small outpost. A steady stream of German immigrants to Ridgewood in the early 20th century helped to transform Ridgewood from scarcely populated neighborhood to the powerhouse neighborhood it is today. </p>
